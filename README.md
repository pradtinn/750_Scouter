# What is Scouter?
Scouter is an Android application developed in Android Studio designed for scouting in VEX Robotics competitions

The process of scouting requires competitive, probationary, and sometimes non-competitive members to record information about
other teams' robots, which revolves around their qualitative design features and quantitative performance

This application makes scouting an easier and more efficient process by providing a simple user interface that makes recording
information in the fast-paced nature of VEX Robotics competitions much less of a hassle
